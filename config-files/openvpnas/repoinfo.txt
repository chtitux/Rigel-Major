IMPORTING THE PUBLIC GPG KEY

These Debian packages and associated repository files have been signed with GPG. 
Therefore, you need to import proper public key or you get warnings when updating 
software catalogs (e.g. when doing apt-get update):

$ wget -O - http://repos.openvpn.net/repos/repo-public.gpg|apt-key add -


ADDING THE REPOSITORY FILE

You also need to download a sources.list fragment so that apt can find these 
packages:

$ cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d
$ wget http://repos.openvpn.net/repos/apt/conf/repos.openvpn.net-precise-snapshots.list


INSTALLING PACKAGES

In most cases, this is as simple as

$ apt-get update && apt-get install <packagename>
