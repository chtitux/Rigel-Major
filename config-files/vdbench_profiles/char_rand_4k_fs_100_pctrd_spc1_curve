# 
# Configuration file borrows a little bit from Richard Elling's original
# vdbench characterization profiles. This particular profile will run read only
# tests without scaling recordsize, adjusting the IO rate on a curve, based on 
# SPC-1 workload specification, all at 32 threads.
#
# Filesystem characterization using fixed 4KB recordsize random I/O for vdbench

# Note: file storage definition (fsd) set elsewhere

# File Workload Definitions (fwd)
## Ignore these, left as a reference. Current File Workload definition mixes reads and writes
## on each file, as opposed to a separate read and write runs.
##
# // => fwd=fwd1,fsd=fsd*,operation=read,fileio=random,fileselect=random,stopafter=1000
# // => fwd=fwd2,fsd=fsd*,operation=write,fileio=random,fileselect=random,stopafter=1000

## Uncomment first fwd line below, and comment line after it to disable synchronous 
## sementics imposed by the openflags=o_sync option

# // => With this `fwd` a dedicated ZIL device will not see much, if any use.
# fwd=fwd_W,fsd=fsd*,rdpct=60,fileio=random,fileselect=random,stopafter=100,xfersize=4k

# // => If ZIL device, such as ZeusRAM is present, use this `fwd` to heavily leverage the ZIL
fwd=fwd_W,fsd=fsd*,rdpct=100,fileio=random,fileselect=random,stopafter=100,xfersize=4k,openflags=o_sync


# Run Definitions (rd)

## Run Definition with following settings:
##
# => 4k Recordsize, sliding to 128K
# => IO rate is on a curve, (default curve is 10, 50, 70,80, 90, and 100%); see SPC-1 specification
# => Mixed Read/Write operation
# => Data structure is created during start of run
# => Each run will last 240 seconds (4min)
# => Threads set to 32 for all runs
# => Percentage of reads to writes is set to 100/0% split
# => Reporting interval set to every 5 seconds

## Format dataset first, before running test, but do not re-format if files are already there. 
# IMPORTANT: Export pool after each test to clear ARC.
