# Configuration file borrows a little bit from Richard Elling's original
# vdbench characterization profiles. This particular profile will run several
# iterations of a test with identical recordsize, but increasing number of
# threads and increasing read percentage v. write percentage.

# Filesystem characterization using 4KB random I/O for vdbench

## Run Definition with following settings:
##
# => 4k Recordsize, fixed
# => Unlimited rate of I/O
# => Mixed Read/Write operation
# => Data structure is created during start of run
# => Each run will last 120 seconds (2min)
# => Threads go from 1 to 32, and are increased by doubling between runs
# => Percentage of reads to writes increases from 10 to 100% in steps of 25%
